		<h1> About </h1>
		<p> I was born a young chef in the heart of Italy, and from a young age it 
			was clear that I was born to succeed. My mother's own breast milk was 
			drab and tasteless compared to the food I used to create as an infant. 
			In time I decided to travel across Europe and beyond in search of something 
			that could match my own creations. </p>

		<p> As I traveled the world in search of recipes, I came to realize that the 
			world was boring and mediocre. </p>

		<p> Now then, I have created this site as a way to share my delicious 
			(and sometimes nutritious) recipes with the world.On this web site you 
			are able to find recipes, photos, and watch me (Chef) cook as a perfect 
			example to base your creations on. I hope you find this website engrossing. </p>

		<p> I know that you are all eternally grateful. </p>

		<p> -Chef </p>
