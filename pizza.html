<u>Toppings</u><ul><li>Crushed tomatoes</li><li>Salt and pepper</li><li>Oregano</li><li>Sugar (optional)</li><li>Cheese, shredded</li><li>Olives, bell pepper, artichokes, onion</li><li>Parchment Paper</li><li>Baking sheet or (preferably) Pizza stone</li></ul><h3>Instructions</h3><h4>Crust:    </h4> Start by dissolving yeast into water.  The water should feel neither hot or cold--it should be the same temperature as your skin.  Drop the yeast into the water and stir until the yeast has dissolved.  <br />
<br />
Mix together the flour and salt in a separate bowl, and then slowly add the yeast-water mixture in, while stirring.  <br />
<br />
Dust the countertop with flour well before kneading.  <br />
<br />
Form the water-flour mixture into a ball and place on the counter and knead.  Knead by folding the dough in half, then pressing the dough into the countertop while flattening it out again, then turn the dough a quarter of the way around.  <br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes, or once the dough can easily maintain its shape, form it into a ball.  Cover the dough-ball with a wet cloth or cling wrap and let it sit at room temperature or slightly warmer for about an hour.  You can also prepare the dough a day or two ahead, and let it rise in the fridge overnight.  <h4>Toppings:</h4> For the sauce, mix crushed tomatoes with a bit of salt, pepper, oregano and some sugar (if you wish).<br />
<br />
Shred cheese and chop up your toppings  I often use olives, red pepper and onion with mozzarella cheese, but you can use whatever toppings you like.  Express yourself!<h4>Assembly:</h4> Before you start assembling your pizza, turn on the oven heat to 500 degrees--or hotter, if your oven will allow it.  The best pizza is cooked at a very high heat.  If you have a pizza stone, put it in the oven to preheat.<br />
<br />
Put your risen dough ball on the parchment paper and spread it out to your desired pizza size.  The thinner the better!  Add your cheese and toppings.<br />
<br />
Bake for about 10 minutes, then enjoy! </p>
